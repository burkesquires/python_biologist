    "\"We have initially tested several systems, including, Bpipe [9], Moa [https://github.com/mfiers/Moa], Ruffus [28], and Snakemake [10]. We have since focused on exploring Snakemake due to, among other features, __its make-like workflow definition, simple integration with Python, Bash code portability, ease of porting workflows to a cluster, intuitive parallelization, and ongoing active development__. We are currently working on extending Snakemake with a lightweight modular system for development cycle control and policy-based specification of rules and requirements that supports an in-flow enforcement of consistency constraints. We have developed and validated a proof-of-concept prototype of the mechanism and automated the code generation of rules.\" [Source](https://biologydirect.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13062-015-0071-8)"

    "It is almost impossible to cover all available workflow management systems, but I can give you a few points: \n",
    "* compared to GNU Make, Snakemake is more flexible, supporting e.g. multiple output files, Python scripting, conditional inputs, arbitrary resource constraints, cluster execution with DRMAA. \n",
    "* Snakefiles can look very clean and readable (almost self documenting). \n",
    "* Snakemake allows you to easily separate workflow logic from analysis logic (in the form of e.g. external scripts), without having to write boilerplate code. This further supports readability and also code re-use. \n",
    "* We are building a library of Snakemake wrappers around popular bioinformatics tools. \n",
    "* Soon, Snakemake will support the automatic installation of the software dependencies of your workflow e.g. via Bioconda. This allows to deploy and execute a workflow on a new machine in a single step.\n",
