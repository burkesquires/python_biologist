    "In the notebook we will learn how to use the `python` programming language to write a program or script that converts temperatures between Fahrenheit to Celsius and back. As you may recall, Fahrenheit and centigrade are two temperature scales in use today. The Fahrenheit scale was developed by the German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. In the Fahrenheit scale, water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees. The centigrade scale, which is also called the Celsius scale, was developed by Swedish astronomer Andres Celsius. In the centigrade scale, water freezes at 0 degrees and boils at 100 degrees. \n",
