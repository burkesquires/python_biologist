Biopython notebook Tutorials
============================

Jupyter Notebooks to introduce Biopython.

Click the `launch binder` badge below to get started in an active Jupyter session working through the Biopython tutorials right in your browser with no installations needed. The active session is served via [MyBinder.org](http://mybinder.org).

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tiagoantao/biopython-notebook/master?filepath=notebooks%2F00%20-%20Tutorial%20-%20Index.ipynb)

GitHub renders Jupyter notebooks, and so you can also browse the notebooks in static form by starting at the [Tutorial Index notebook](00%20-%20Tutorial%20-%20Index.ipynb). If you prefer the nicer renderings generated by nbviewer, go [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/tiagoantao/biopython-notebook/blob/master/notebooks/00%20-%20Tutorial%20-%20Index.ipynb) to browse the notebooks in static form.

Content Attribution 
-------------------

The vast majority of the content is scooped from somewhere else. This project is focused on making this existing content available and interactive with Jupyter notebooks.

Most content here is based on the [Biopython tutorial](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html).

Related tutorials
-----------------

The [Biopython tutorial](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html) forms the source for much of the material you'll find here.

There is a seperate Biopython Notebook tutorial [here](https://github.com/chris-rands/biopython-coronavirus) on how to characterize a small sequence like a coronavirus genome.

Docker Containers
-----------------

- A Docker image with these notebooks is available here
[https://hub.docker.com/r/biopython/biopython-tutorial/](https://hub.docker.com/r/biopython/biopython-tutorial/).

- Other Biopython Docker containers are available here [https://hub.docker.com/u/biopython/](https://hub.docker.com/u/biopython/).

- Basic Docker instructions can be found here [https://github.com/biopython/biopython_docker](https://github.com/biopython/biopython_docker).


Python version
--------------

We support Python 3 out of the box. Legacy versions (e.g. Python 2) are
currently not supported.
