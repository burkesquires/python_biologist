    "Cluster analysis\n",
    "================\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster analysis is the grouping of items into clusters based on the\n",
    "similarity of the items to each other. In bioinformatics, clustering is\n",
    "widely used in gene expression data analysis to find groups of genes\n",
    "with similar gene expression profiles. This may identify functionally\n",
    "related genes, as well as suggest the function of presently unknown\n",
    "genes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Biopython module `Bio.Cluster` provides commonly used clustering\n",
    "algorithms and was designed with the application to gene expression data\n",
    "in mind. However, this module can also be used for cluster analysis of\n",
    "other types of data. `Bio.Cluster` and the underlying C Clustering\n",
    "Library is described by De Hoon *et al.* @dehoon2004.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following four clustering approaches are implemented in\n",
    "`Bio.Cluster`:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Hierarchical clustering (pairwise centroid-, single-, complete-, and\n",
    "    average-linkage);\n",
    "\n",
    "-   $k$-means, $k$-medians, and $k$-medoids clustering;\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Self-Organizing Maps;\n",

    "-   Principal Component Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data representation {#data-representation .unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "The data to be clustered are represented by a $n \\times m$ Numerical\n",
    "Python array `data`. Within the context of gene expression data\n",
    "clustering, typically the rows correspond to different genes whereas the\n",
    "columns correspond to different experimental conditions. The clustering\n",
    "algorithms in `Bio.Cluster` can be applied both to rows (genes) and to\n",
    "columns (experiments).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing values {#missing-values .unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Often in microarray experiments, some of the data values are missing,\n",
    "which is indicated by an additional $n \\times m$ Numerical Python\n",
    "integer array `mask`. If `mask[i,j]==0`, then `data[i,j]` is missing and\n",
    "is ignored in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random number generator {#random-number-generator .unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "The $k$-means/medians/medoids clustering algorithms and Self-Organizing\n",
    "Maps (SOMs) include the use of a random number generator. The uniform\n",
    "random number generator in `Bio.Cluster` is based on the algorithm by\n",
    "L’Ecuyer @lecuyer1988, while random numbers following the binomial\n",
    "distribution are generated using the BTPE algorithm by Kachitvichyanukul\n",
    "and Schmeiser @kachitvichyanukul1988. The random number generator is\n",
    "initialized automatically during its first call. As this random number\n",
    "generator uses a combination of two multiplicative linear congruential\n",
    "generators, two (integer) seeds are needed for initialization, for which\n",
    "we use the system-supplied random number generator `rand` (in the C\n",
    "standard library). We initialize this generator by calling `srand` with\n",
    "the epoch time in seconds, and use the first two random numbers\n",
    "generated by `rand` as seeds for the uniform random number generator in\n",
    "`Bio.Cluster`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distance functions {#sec:distancefunctions}\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to cluster items into groups based on their similarity, we\n",
    "should first define what exactly we mean by *similar*. `Bio.Cluster`\n",
    "provides eight distance functions, indicated by a single character, to\n",
    "measure similarity, or conversely, distance:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `'e'`: Euclidean distance;\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `'b'`: City-block distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `'c'`: Pearson correlation coefficient;\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `'a'`: Absolute value of the Pearson correlation coefficient;\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `'u'`: Uncentered Pearson correlation (equivalent to the cosine of\n",
    "    the angle between two data vectors);\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `'x'`: Absolute uncentered Pearson correlation;\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `'s'`: Spearman’s rank correlation;\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `'k'`: Kendall’s $\\tau$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two are true distance functions that satisfy the triangle\n",
    "inequality:\n",
    "$$d\\left(\\underline{u},\\underline{v}\\right) \\leq d\\left(\\underline{u},\\underline{w}\\right) + d\\left(\\underline{w},\\underline{v}\\right) \\textrm{ for all } \\underline{u}, \\underline{v}, \\underline{w},$$\n",
    "and are therefore refered to as *metrics*. In everyday language, this\n",
    "means that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining six distance measures are related to the correlation\n",
    "coefficient, where the distance $d$ is defined in terms of the\n",
    "correlation $r$ by $d=1-r$. Note that these distance functions are\n",
    "*semi-metrics* that do not satisfy the triangle inequality. For example,\n",
    "for $$\\underline{u}=\\left(1,0,-1\\right);$$\n",
    "$$\\underline{v}=\\left(1,1,0\\right);$$\n",
    "$$\\underline{w}=\\left(0,1,1\\right);$$ we find a Pearson distance\n",
    "$d\\left(\\underline{u},\\underline{w}\\right) = 1.8660$, while\n",
    "$d\\left(\\underline{u},\\underline{v}\\right)+d\\left(\\underline{v},\\underline{w}\\right) = 1.6340$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Euclidean distance {#euclidean-distance .unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Bio.Cluster`, we define the Euclidean distance as\n",
    "$$d = {1 \\over n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(x_i-y_i\\right)^{2}.$$ Only those\n",
    "terms are included in the summation for which both $x_i$ and $y_i$ are\n",
    "present, and the denominator $n$ is chosen accordingly. As the\n",
    "expression data $x_i$ and $y_i$ are subtracted directly from each other,\n",
    "we should make sure that the expression data are properly normalized\n",
    "when using the Euclidean distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### City-block distance {#city-block-distance .unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "The city-block distance, alternatively known as the Manhattan distance,\n",
    "is related to the Euclidean distance. Whereas the Euclidean distance\n",
    "corresponds to the length of the shortest path between two points, the\n",
    "city-block distance is the sum of distances along each dimension. As\n",
    "gene expression data tend to have missing values, in `Bio.Cluster` we\n",
    "define the city-block distance as the sum of distances divided by the\n",
    "number of dimensions:\n",
    "$$d = {1 \\over n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left|x_i-y_i\\right|.$$ This is equal to\n",
    "the distance you would have to walk between two points in a city, where\n",
    "you have to walk along city blocks. As for the Euclidean distance, the\n",
    "expression data are subtracted directly from each other, and we should\n",
    "therefore make sure that they are properly normalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Pearson correlation coefficient {#the-pearson-correlation-coefficient .unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient is defined as\n",
    "$$r = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( \\frac{x_i -\\bar{x}}{\\sigma_x} \\right) \\left(\\frac{y_i -\\bar{y}}{\\sigma_y} \\right),$$\n",
    "in which $\\bar{x}, \\bar{y}$ are the sample mean of $x$ and $y$\n",
    "respectively, and $\\sigma_x, \\sigma_y$ are the sample standard deviation\n",
    "of $x$ and $y$. The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure for how\n",
    "well a straight line can be fitted to a scatterplot of $x$ and $y$. If\n",
    "all the points in the scatterplot lie on a straight line, the Pearson\n",
    "correlation coefficient is either +1 or -1, depending on whether the\n",
    "slope of line is positive or negative. If the Pearson correlation\n",
    "coefficient is equal to zero, there is no correlation between $x$ and\n",
    "$y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Pearson distance* is then defined as\n",
    "$$d_{\\textrm{P}} \\equiv 1 - r.$$ As the Pearson correlation coefficient\n",
    "lies between -1 and 1, the Pearson distance lies between 0 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Absolute Pearson correlation {#absolute-pearson-correlation .unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "By taking the absolute value of the Pearson correlation, we find a\n",
    "number between 0 and 1. If the absolute value is 1, all the points in\n",
    "the scatter plot lie on a straight line with either a positive or a\n",
    "negative slope. If the absolute value is equal to zero, there is no\n",
    "correlation between $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding distance is defined as\n",
    "$$d_{\\textrm A} \\equiv 1 - \\left|r\\right|,$$ where $r$ is the Pearson\n",
    "correlation coefficient. As the absolute value of the Pearson\n",
    "correlation coefficient lies between 0 and 1, the corresponding distance\n",
    "lies between 0 and 1 as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of gene expression experiments, the absolute correlation\n",
    "is equal to 1 if the gene expression profiles of two genes are either\n",
    "exactly the same or exactly opposite. The absolute correlation\n",
    "coefficient should therefore be used with care.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uncentered correlation (cosine of the angle) {#uncentered-correlation-cosine-of-the-angle .unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, it may be preferable to use the *uncentered correlation*\n",
    "instead of the regular Pearson correlation coefficient. The uncentered\n",
    "correlation is defined as\n",
    "$$r_{\\textrm U} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{x_i}{\\sigma_x^{(0)}} \\right) \\left(\\frac{y_i}{\\sigma_y^{(0)}} \\right),$$\n",
    "where $$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\sigma_x^{(0)} & = & \\sqrt{{\\frac{1}{n}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2}; \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "\\sigma_y^{(0)} & = & \\sqrt{{\\frac{1}{n}} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i^2}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "This is the same expression as for the regular Pearson correlation\n",
    "coefficient, except that the sample means $\\bar{x}, \\bar{y}$ are set\n",
    "equal to zero. The uncentered correlation may be appropriate if there is\n",
    "a zero reference state. For instance, in the case of gene expression\n",
    "data given in terms of log-ratios, a log-ratio equal to zero corresponds\n",
    "to the green and red signal being equal, which means that the\n",
    "experimental manipulation did not affect the gene expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance corresponding to the uncentered correlation coefficient is\n",
    "defined as $$d_{\\mbox{U}} \\equiv 1 - r_{\\mbox{U}},$$ where\n",
    "$r_{\\mbox{U}}$ is the uncentered correlation. As the uncentered\n",
    "correlation coefficient lies between -1 and 1, the corresponding\n",
    "distance lies between 0 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The uncentered correlation is equal to the cosine of the angle of the\n",
    "two data vectors in $n$-dimensional space, and is often referred to as\n",
    "such.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Absolute uncentered correlation {#absolute-uncentered-correlation .unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the regular Pearson correlation, we can define a distance measure\n",
    "using the absolute value of the uncentered correlation:\n",
    "$$d_{\\mbox{AU}} \\equiv 1 - \\left|r_{\\mbox{U}}\\right|,$$ where\n",
    "$r_{\\mbox{U}}$ is the uncentered correlation coefficient. As the\n",
    "absolute value of the uncentered correlation coefficient lies between 0\n",
    "and 1, the corresponding distance lies between 0 and 1 as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrically, the absolute value of the uncentered correlation is equal\n",
    "to the cosine between the supporting lines of the two data vectors\n",
    "(i.e., the angle without taking the direction of the vectors into\n",
    "consideration).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spearman rank correlation {#spearman-rank-correlation .unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "The Spearman rank correlation is an example of a non-parametric\n",
    "similarity measure, and tends to be more robust against outliers than\n",
    "the Pearson correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the Spearman rank correlation, we replace each data value\n",
    "by their rank if we would order the data in each vector by their value.\n",
    "We then calculate the Pearson correlation between the two rank vectors\n",
    "instead of the data vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the case of the Pearson correlation, we can define a distance\n",
    "measure corresponding to the Spearman rank correlation as\n",
    "$$d_{\\mbox{S}} \\equiv 1 - r_{\\mbox{S}},$$ where $r_{\\mbox{S}}$ is the\n",
    "Spearman rank correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kendall’s $\\tau$ {#kendalls-tau .unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "Kendall’s $\\tau$ is another example of a non-parametric similarity\n",
    "measure. It is similar to the Spearman rank correlation, but instead of\n",
    "the ranks themselves only the relative ranks are used to calculate\n",
    "$\\tau$ (see Snedecor & Cochran @snedecor1989).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define a distance measure corresponding to Kendall’s $\\tau$ as\n",
    "$$d_{\\mbox{K}} \\equiv 1 - \\tau.$$ As Kendall’s $\\tau$ is always between\n",
    "-1 and 1, the corresponding distance will be between 0 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weighting {#weighting .unnumbered}\n",
    "\n",
    "For most of the distance functions available in `Bio.Cluster`, a weight\n",
    "vector can be applied. The weight vector contains weights for the items\n",
    "in the data vector. If the weight for item $i$ is $w_i$, then that item\n",

    "Hierarchical clustering\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering methods are inherently different from the\n",
    "$k$-means clustering method. In hierarchical clustering, the similarity\n",
    "in the expression profile between genes or experimental conditions are\n",
    "represented in the form of a tree structure. This tree structure can be\n",
    "shown graphically by programs such as Treeview and Java Treeview, which\n",
    "has contributed to the popularity of hierarchical clustering in the\n",
    "analysis of gene expression data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in hierarchical clustering is to calculate the distance\n",
    "matrix, specifying all the distances between the items to be clustered.\n",
    "Next, we create a node by joining the two closest items. Subsequent\n",
    "nodes are created by pairwise joining of items or nodes based on the\n",
    "distance between them, until all items belong to the same node. A tree\n",
    "structure can then be created by retracing which items and nodes were\n",
    "merged. Unlike the EM algorithm, which is used in $k$-means clustering,\n",
    "the complete process of hierarchical clustering is deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several flavors of hierarchical clustering exist, which differ in how\n",
    "the distance between subnodes is defined in terms of their members. In\n",
    "`Bio.Cluster`, pairwise single, maximum, average, and centroid linkage\n",
    "are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In pairwise single-linkage clustering, the distance between two\n",
    "    nodes is defined as the shortest distance among the pairwise\n",
    "    distances between the members of the two nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In pairwise maximum-linkage clustering, alternatively known as\n",
    "    pairwise complete-linkage clustering, the distance between two nodes\n",
    "    is defined as the longest distance among the pairwise distances\n",
    "    between the members of the two nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In pairwise average-linkage clustering, the distance between two\n",
    "    nodes is defined as the average over all pairwise distances between\n",
    "    the items of the two nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   In pairwise centroid-linkage clustering, the distance between two\n",
    "    nodes is defined as the distance between their centroids. The\n",
    "    centroids are calculated by taking the mean over all the items in\n",
    "    a cluster. As the distance from each newly formed node to existing\n",
    "    nodes and items need to be calculated at each step, the computing\n",
    "    time of pairwise centroid-linkage clustering may be significantly\n",
    "    longer than for the other hierarchical clustering methods. Another\n",
    "    peculiarity is that (for a distance measure based on the Pearson\n",
    "    correlation), the distances do not necessarily increase when going\n",
    "    up in the clustering tree, and may even decrease. This is caused by\n",
    "    an inconsistency between the centroid calculation and the distance\n",
    "    calculation when using the Pearson correlation: Whereas the Pearson\n",
    "    correlation effectively normalizes the data for the distance\n",
    "    calculation, no such normalization occurs for the\n",
    "    centroid calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For pairwise single-, complete-, and average-linkage clustering, the\n",
    "distance between two nodes can be found directly from the distances\n",
    "between the individual items. Therefore, the clustering algorithm does\n",
    "not need access to the original gene expression data, once the distance\n",
    "matrix is known. For pairwise centroid-linkage clustering, however, the\n",
    "centroids of newly formed subnodes can only be calculated from the\n",
    "original data and not from the distance matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of pairwise single-linkage hierarchical clustering is\n",
    "based on the SLINK algorithm (R. Sibson, 1973), which is much faster and\n",
    "more memory-efficient than a straightforward implementation of pairwise\n",
    "single-linkage clustering. The clustering result produced by this\n",
    "algorithm is identical to the clustering solution found by the\n",
    "conventional single-linkage algorithm. The single-linkage hierarchical\n",
    "clustering algorithm implemented in this library can be used to cluster\n",

    "principal components, which are ordered and chosen such that each\n",

    "example, an $n \\times 3$ data matrix can be represented as an\n",
    "ellipsoidal cloud of $n$ points in three dimensional space. The first\n",
    "principal component is the longest axis of the ellipsoid, the second\n",
    "principal component the second longest axis of the ellipsoid, and the\n",
    "third principal component is the shortest axis. Each row in the data\n",
    "matrix can be reconstructed as a suitable linear combination of the\n",
    "principal components. However, in order to reduce the dimensionality of\n",

    "Before applying principal component analysis, typically the mean is\n",
