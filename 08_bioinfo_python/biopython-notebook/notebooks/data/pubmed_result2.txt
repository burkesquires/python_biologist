TI  - A high level interface to SCOP and ASTRAL implemented in python.
PG  - 10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Benchmarking algorithms in structural bioinformatics often involves
      the construction of datasets of proteins with given sequence and structural
      properties. The SCOP database is a manually curated structural classification
      which groups together proteins on the basis of structural similarity. The ASTRAL 
      compendium provides non redundant subsets of SCOP domains on the basis of
      sequence similarity such that no two domains in a given subset share more than a 
      defined degree of sequence similarity. Taken together these two resources provide
      a 'ground truth' for assessing structural bioinformatics algorithms. We present a
      small and easy to use API written in python to enable construction of datasets
      from these resources. RESULTS: We have designed a set of python modules to
      provide an abstraction of the SCOP and ASTRAL databases. The modules are designed
      to work as part of the Biopython distribution. Python users can now manipulate
      and use the SCOP hierarchy from within python programs, and use ASTRAL to return 
      sequences of domains in SCOP, as well as clustered representations of SCOP from
      ASTRAL. CONCLUSION: The modules make the analysis and generation of datasets for 
      use in structural genomics easier and more principled.

TI  - GenomeDiagram: a python package for the visualization of large-scale genomic
      data.
PG  - 616-7
AB  - SUMMARY: We present GenomeDiagram, a flexible, open-source Python module for the 
      visualization of large-scale genomic, comparative genomic and other data with
      reference to a single chromosome or other biological sequence. GenomeDiagram may 
      be used to generate publication-quality vector graphics, rastered images and
      in-line streamed graphics for webpages. The package integrates with datatypes
      from the BioPython project, and is available for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X
      systems. AVAILABILITY: GenomeDiagram is freely available as source code (under
      GNU Public License) at http://bioinf.scri.ac.uk/lp/programs.html, and requires
      Python 2.3 or higher, and recent versions of the ReportLab and BioPython
      packages. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A user manual, example code and images are
      available at http://bioinf.scri.ac.uk/lp/programs.html.

TI  - Open source clustering software.
PG  - 1453-4
AB  - SUMMARY: We have implemented k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering and
      self-organizing maps in a single multipurpose open-source library of C routines, 
      callable from other C and C++ programs. Using this library, we have created an
      improved version of Michael Eisen's well-known Cluster program for Windows, Mac
      OS X and Linux/Unix. In addition, we generated a Python and a Perl interface to
      the C Clustering Library, thereby combining the flexibility of a scripting
      language with the speed of C. AVAILABILITY: The C Clustering Library and the
      corresponding Python C extension module Pycluster were released under the Python 
      License, while the Perl module Algorithm::Cluster was released under the Artistic
      License. The GUI code Cluster 3.0 for Windows, Macintosh and Linux/Unix, as well 
      as the corresponding command-line program, were released under the same license
      as the original Cluster code. The complete source code is available at
      http://bonsai.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/mdehoon/software/cluster. Alternatively,
      Algorithm::Cluster can be downloaded from CPAN, while Pycluster is also available
      as part of the Biopython distribution.

TI  - PDB file parser and structure class implemented in Python.
PG  - 2308-10
AB  - The biopython project provides a set of bioinformatics tools implemented in
      Python. Recently, biopython was extended with a set of modules that deal with
      macromolecular structure. Biopython now contains a parser for PDB files that
      makes the atomic information available in an easy-to-use but powerful data
      structure. The parser and data structure deal with features that are often left
      out or handled inadequately by other packages, e.g. atom and residue disorder (if
      point mutants are present in the crystal), anisotropic B factors, multiple models
      and insertion codes. In addition, the parser performs some sanity checking to
      detect obvious errors. AVAILABILITY: The Biopython distribution (including source
      code and documentation) is freely available (under the Biopython license) from
      http://www.biopython.org
