Once you get beyond the sequence itself, you need some way to organize and easily get at the more 'abstract' information that is known about the sequence. While it is probably impossible to develop a general sequence feature class that will cover everything, the Biopython SeqFeature class attempts to encapsulate as much of the information about the sequence as possible.
