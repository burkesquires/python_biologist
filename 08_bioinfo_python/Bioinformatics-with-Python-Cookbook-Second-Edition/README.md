This is the code repository for [Bioinformatics with Python Cookbook, Second Edition](https://india.packtpub.com/in/big-data-and-business-intelligence/bioinformatics-python-cookbook-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789344691), published by Packt.

**Learn how to use modern Python bioinformatics libraries and applications to do cutting-edge research in computational biology**

## What is this book about?
Bioinformatics is an active research field that uses a range of simple-to-advanced computations to extract valuable information from biological data.
This book covers next-generation sequencing, genomics, metagenomics, population genetics, phylogenetics, and proteomics. You'll learn modern programming techniques to analyze large amounts of biological data. With the help of real-world examples, you'll convert, analyze, and visualize datasets using various Python tools and libraries.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Learn how to process large next-generation sequencing (NGS) datasets
* Work with genomic dataset using the FASTQ, BAM, and VCF formats
* Learn to perform sequence comparison and phylogenetic reconstruction
* Perform complex analysis with protemics data
* Use Python to interact with Galaxy servers

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
import os
from IPython.display import Image
import rpy2.robjects as robjects
import pandas as pd
from rpy2.robjects import pandas2ri
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
	This book is for data scientists, bioinformatics analysts, researchers, and Python developers who want to address intermediate-to-advanced biological and bioinformatics problems using a recipe-based approach. Working knowledge of the Python programming language is expected.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).

## Get to Know the Author
**Tiago Antao**
 is a bioinformatician currently working in the field of genomics. He was
originally a computer scientist but he crossed over to computational biology with an MSc in
Bioinformatics from the Faculty of Sciences at the University of Porto, Portugal, and a PhD
on the spread of drug-resistant malaria from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in
the UK. He is one of the co-authors of Biopython, a major bioinformatics package written in
Python.
In his post-doctoral career, he has worked with human datasets at the University of
Cambridge (UK) and with mosquito whole genome sequence data at the University of
Oxford (UK). He is currently working as a research scientist at the University of Montana.
