    "Visualizing categorical data\n",
    "============================\n",
    "  \n",
    "In the :ref:`relational plot tutorial <relational_tutorial>` we saw how to use different visual representations to show the relationship between multiple variables in a dataset. In the examples, we focused on cases where the main relationship was between two numerical variables. If one of the main variables is \"categorical\" (divided into discrete groups) it may be helpful to use a more specialized approach to visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In seaborn, there are several different ways to visualize a relationship involving categorical data. Similar to the relationship between :func:`relplot` and either :func:`scatterplot` or :func:`lineplot`, there are two ways to make these plots. There are a number of axes-level functions for plotting categorical data in different ways and a figure-level interface, :func:`catplot`, that gives unified higher-level access to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's helpful to think of the different categorical plot kinds as belonging to three different families, which we'll discuss in detail below. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical scatterplots:\n",
    "\n",
    "- :func:`stripplot` (with ``kind=\"strip\"``; the default)\n",
    "- :func:`swarmplot` (with ``kind=\"swarm\"``)\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical distribution plots:\n",
    "\n",
    "- :func:`boxplot` (with ``kind=\"box\"``)\n",
    "- :func:`violinplot` (with ``kind=\"violin\"``)\n",
    "- :func:`boxenplot` (with ``kind=\"boxen\"``)\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical estimate plots:\n",
    "\n",
    "- :func:`pointplot` (with ``kind=\"point\"``)\n",
    "- :func:`barplot` (with ``kind=\"bar\"``)\n",
    "- :func:`countplot` (with ``kind=\"count\"``)\n",
    "\n",
    "These families represent the data using different levels of granularity. When deciding which to use, you'll have to think about the question that you want to answer. The unified API makes it easy to switch between different kinds and see your data from several perspectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll mostly focus on the figure-level interface, :func:`catplot`. Remember that this function is a higher-level interface each of the functions above, so we'll reference them when we show each kind of plot, keeping the more verbose kind-specific API documentation at hand."
