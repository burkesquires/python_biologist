    "As a data visualization library, seaborn requires that you provide it with data. This chapter explains the various ways to accomplish that task. Seaborn supports several different dataset formats, and most functions accept data represented with objects from the `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ or `numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_ libraries as well as built-in Python types like lists and dictionaries. Understanding the usage patterns associated with these different options will help you quickly create useful visualizations for nearly any dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    ".. note::\n",
    "   As of current writing (v0.11.0), the full breadth of options covered here are supported by only a subset of the modules in seaborn (namely, the :ref:`relational <relational_api>` and :ref:`distribution <distribution_api>` modules). The other modules offer much of the same flexibility, but have some exceptions (e.g., :func:`catplot` and :func:`lmplot` are limited to long-form data with named variables). The data-ingest code will be standardized over the next few release cycles, but until that point, be mindful of the specific documentation for each function if it is not doing what you expect with your dataset."
