    "\n",
    "Many other transforms exist as well, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``transform_lookup()``: this lets you perform one-sided joins of multiple datasets. It is used often, for example, in geographic visualizations where you join data (such as unemployment within states) to data about geographic regions used to represent that data\n",
    "- ``transform_window()``: this lets you perform aggregates across sliding windows, for example computing local means of data. It was recently added to Vega-Lite, and so the Altair API for this transform is not yet very convenient.\n",
