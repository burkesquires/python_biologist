    "\n",
    "- various marks: ``mark_point()``, ``mark_line()``, ``mark_tick()``, ``mark_bar()``, ``mark_area()``, ``mark_rect()``, etc.\n",
    "- various encodings: ``x``, ``y``, ``color``, ``shape``, ``size``, ``row``, ``column``, ``text``, ``tooltip``, etc.\n",
    "- binning and aggregations: a [List of available aggregations](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/encoding.html#binning-and-aggregation) can be found in Altair's documentation\n",
    "- stacking and layering (``alt.layer`` <-> ``+``, ``alt.hconcat`` <-> ``|``, ``alt.vconcat`` <-> ``&``)\n",
    "\n",
    "Start simple and build from there. Which encodings work best with quantitative data? With categorical data?\n",

    "We'll set aside about 20 minutes for you to work on this with your partner."
